          <p>Abstract</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a pattern recognition method combining artificial neural network and deep learning theory. CNN’s parallel architecture is the foundation and core of CNN’s overall computing architecture. Field programmable gate array (FPGA) can give full play to the parallel characteristics of convolutional neural network. The neural network is realized by using the special multiplier and digital signal processing unit in FPGA. It can perform a large number of multiplication and addition operations in the algorithm in high parallel. Convolution neural network is composed of convolution layer, pooling layer and other layers with different functions, and convolution operation often consumes a lot of time. FPGA sharing this part of resources can effectively speed up the forward propagation and back-propagation process of convolutional neural network.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Python, a scripting language, makes project development easier. The PYNQ-Z1 from Xilinx Inc. integrates the FPGA and Python ARM, enabling fully embedded neural networks to be implemented.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In this research, FPGA is used as the hardware platform, and the speed of image classification by convolutional neural network is improved by 8.2 times compared with the software processing method. The hardware acceleration of convolutional neural network is well realized. This research also uses WindowsPC as a client and PYNQ-Z1 as a server to build the entire neural network system. The application program on the Windows PC side and the server program on the PYNQ-Z1 side were implemented. Combined with the PYNQ-Z1 neural network and the FPGA parallel accelerator of the same research group, a complete set of operational neural network systems was realized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hardware CNN Accelerator</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traditional convolutional neural networks are constructed by many different network layers, including convolution layer, pooling layer, activation layer and full connection layer. The convolution layer realizes the two-dimensional convolution of the image. The pooling layer can aggregate the features and reduce the amount of computation. The activation layer uses the activation function to map the input data between 0 and 1. The full connection layer is responsible for mapping the learned feature map to the output sample space. The structure of convolution neural network is shown in the figure below</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Traditional FPGA design builds module RTL model manually. Although RTL model can provide the best performance with optimal resources, it takes a lot of time to write RTL. At the same time, large-scale RTL model also has low readability and high maintenance difficulty.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Vivado HLS high level synthesis tool is based on the IP core design of FPGA. The tool can create and synthesize IP core through C, C + + and system C, and does not need to create RTL model manually. It also supports ise and vivado design environment. It greatly reduces the design time and development difficulty.</p>
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, in this design, we use high-level synthesis tools based on vivado HLS and use C language to design the hardware circuit.</p>

<p>Binocular stereo vision is the research focus in the field of computer vision. Usually, two identical cameras are used to obtain two digital images of the surrounding objects from different angles, and the 3D geometric information of the objects is recovered based on the parallax principle to reconstruct the 3D shape and position of the surrounding objects.<br>Based on the binocular stereo system, this project studies the calibration and calibration, salient object extraction, stereo matching and reconstruction technology of binocular stereo camera. To obtain meaningful 3D images of ground scene provides a new technical means for virtual reality, augmented reality and other consumer electronic products.</p>

<p>Calibration Method</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zhang’s classical calibration method uses two-dimensional checkerboard as the calibration object, which simplifies the calibration process, reduces the cost of camera calibration, but also maintains high calibration accuracy. With its advantages of high precision and good flexibility, it is still the most common calibration method in camera calibration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Epipolar rectification can be carried out with camera calibration and without camera calibration. Due to the existence of a large number of uncalibrated image pairs in stereo vision, it is difficult to match stereoscopically directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The self calibration method gets rid of the limitation of the calibration board, so it is more flexible and practical. However, the calibration accuracy is far different from the plane calibration method, which is the biggest restriction of its practical application.</p>

          <p>A digital controller for single-inductor dual-output switching converter with low cross regulation</p>
<p>Supervisor of this research is Lecture <label style="color:red">Daying Sun</label>.</p>
<p>Circuit Structure</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The whole structure of this research uses the digital controller’s SIDO buck converter. A/D converter(ADC) was used to sample the output voltage and inductance current of the two output branches and several PWM driven transistors were used as switches to control the output voltage. The digital duty cycle of each switch cycle is calculated by digital control algorithm, and the final duty cycle signal of switch tube is converted by DPWM module.</p>
</blockquote>
<img src="/2017/06/25/sido/sido1.jpg" class="" title="This is an example image">

<p>Output and Steady State</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The waveform of output voltage, inductance current and duty cycle signal is shown in the figure.</p>
</blockquote>
<img src="/2017/06/25/sido/sido2.jpg" class="" title="This is an example image">

<blockquote>
<p>During each period, when one output branch is charged, the other output branch will be discharged. By calculating the output current and inductance current in each cycle, the relationship between each voltage output capacitor and inductance is found.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When any branch of the SIDO converter reaches steady state, the charging capacity of the output capacitor must be equal to that of the output capacitor. In order to meet the steady-state condition, the initial inductance current and duty cycle can be changed in a certain range at the beginning of each cycle. For each output branch, it has a specific initial inductance current and duty cycle range to meet the steady-state conditions. At the same time, the SIDO converter requires two output branches to reach steady state in steady state, and the terminal charging inductance current of one branch is also the initial charging inductance current of the other branch. This is the intersection of the steady-state range of the two branches, which is the steady state of the SIDO converter.</p>
</blockquote>
<img src="/2017/06/25/sido/sido3.jpg" class="" title="This is an example image">


<p>The Predictive Control Method</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For SIDO converter, cross regulation is inevitable in the transient process. When the load condition of one output branch changes, the steady-state point of the SIDO converter will also change. The new and old stability points are shown in the figure.</p>
</blockquote>
<img src="/2017/06/25/sido/sido4.jpg" class="" title="This is an example image">

<blockquote>
<p>In the process of transition from the old stable point to the new one, if the relationship between the inductance current and the duty cycle of the invariant output branch is always as shown in the figure, the cross regulation of the two output branches can be effectively reduced to the minimum. In order to reduce cross regulation, a new steady state point must be determined. At the beginning of each switching cycle, the output voltage, inductance current and load current are sampled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simulation Verification of the SIDO Converter Resistance to External Interference</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, the inductance current can be predicted. The SIDO buck switching converter with the proposed digital controller has been simulated via the Matlab/Simulink environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<img src="/2017/06/25/sido/sido5.jpg" class="" title="This is an example image">

<blockquote>
<p>The figure shows the output voltage, output current and inductance current of the two output branches of the SIDO converter. When the output load current io2 of the second output branch changes, it is observed that the maximum voltage fluctuation of the first output branch is 11mv.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simulation results show that the SIDO buck converter has good performance in suppressing cross regulation of output voltage.</p>

<p>Background:Many communities areimplementing smart growth initiatives in an effort to consider long range,sustainable planning goals. “Smart growth is about helping every town and citybecome a more economically prosperous, socially equitable, and environmentallysustainable place to live.”[2] Smart growth focuses on building cities thatembrace the E’s of sustainability—Economically prosperous, socially Equitable,and Environmentally Sustainable. This task is more important than ever becausethe world is rapidly urbanizing. It is projected that by 2050, 66 percent ofthe world’s population will be urban—this will result in a projected 2.5billion people being added to the urban population.[3] Consequently, urbanplanning has become increasingly important and necessary to ensure that peoplehave access to equitable and sustainable homes, resources and jobs.Smart growth is an urban planning theorythat originated in 1990’s as a means to curb continued urban sprawl and reducethe loss of farmland surrounding urban centers. The ten principles for smartgrowth are[4]1 Mix land uses2 Take advantage of compact building design3 Create a range of housing opportunitiesand choices4 Create walkable neighborhoods5 Foster distinctive, attractivecommunities with a strong sense of place6 Preserve open space, farmland, naturalbeauty, and critical environmental areas7 Strengthen and direct development towardsexisting communities8 Provide a variety of transportationchoices9 Make development decisions predictable,fair, and cost effective10 Encourage community and stakeholdercollaboration in development decisionsThese broad principles must be tailored toa community’s unique needs to be effective. Thus, any measure of success mustincorporate the demographics, growth needs, and geographical conditions of acity as well as the goal to adhere to the three E’s.Task:The International City ManagementGroup (ICM) needs your help implementing smart growth theories into city designaround the world. Select two mid-sized cities (any city with a population ofbetween 100,000 and 500,000 persons), on two different continents.<br>Define a metric to measure the successof smart growth of a city. It should consider the three E’s of sustainabilityand/or the 10 principles of smart growth.</p>
<p>Research the current growth plan of theselected cities. Measure and discuss how the current growth plan of each citymeets the smart growth principles. How successful are the current plansaccording to your metric?</p>
<p>Using smart growth principles develop agrowth plan for both cities over the next few decades. Support why you chosethe components and initiatives of your plans based on the geography, expectedgrowth rates, and economic opportunities of your cities. Use your metric toevaluate the success of your smart growth plans.</p>
<p>Also using your metric, rank theindividual initiatives within your redesigned smart growth plan as the mostpotential to the least potential. Compare and contrast the initiatives andtheir ranking between the two cities.</p>
<p>Suppose the population of each city willincrease by an additional 50% by 2050, explain in what way(s) your plansupports this level of growth? Your ICM submission should consist of a 1 pageSummary Sheet and your solution cannot exceed 20 pages for a maximum of 21pages. Note: The appendix and references do not count toward the 20 page limit.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In teamwork, I was responsible for data collection. We Defined the multiple indicators of smart cities by quantifying the indicators of Coventry(UK), Pittsburgh(US) and other foreign smart cities as well as domestic smart cities, and collected relevant indicators of 10 major cities in mainland China, evaluated the smart city and ranked the city in terms of city ranking.Prev: Digital Controller of a Single-Inductor, Dual-Output Switch Converter</p>
